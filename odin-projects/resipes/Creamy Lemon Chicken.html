    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>½ cup salted butter</li>
       <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
       <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
       <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Place in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon juice and zest into the leftover butter in the pan, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in half-and-half slowly. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese until sauce is smooth. Pour sauce over chicken. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
